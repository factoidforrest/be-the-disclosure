    <h2>Uploading</h2>
    <p class="font-light">
      At present, uploads can be sent to <a href="mailto:upload@bethedisclosure.com">upload@bethedisclosure.com</a> where they will be manually reviewed and uploaded. 
      The best option is to send a magnet link of the file that you're hosting with your torrent client. You may also include your desired title and description.
      If that is too complicated, you may either send the file hosted somewhere, or attach it to the email if is small.
